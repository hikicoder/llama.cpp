// SSD streaming of MoE routed expert weights
//
// Streamed layers do not materialize their ffn_*_exps tensors; instead each weight gets a
// device-side cache tensor of n_slots expert slabs, filled on demand from the GGUF file by an
// id-remapping custom op that runs on the CPU right after the router top-k. The remap only
// changes which cache slot an expert id resolves to - it never changes which experts the router
// selected, so streaming affects latency, not outputs.
//
// Missing experts are loaded by a pool of I/O threads while the remap op waits; eviction is by
// decaying route hotness with an LRU tiebreak. Reads are buffered by default, or O_DIRECT with
// LLAMA_MOE_STREAM_DIRECT=1 (bypasses the page cache; recommended when the model far exceeds RAM).
//
// note: multiple contexts decoding the same streamed model concurrently are not supported -
// one context can evict slots referenced by the other's in-flight graph.

// Today a miss costs an SSD read into a staging buffer plus a pageable upload: 401.5 us for a
// gate/up slab. Out of pinned host memory the same slab uploads in 56.7 us - 7.08x per transfer.
//
// WHY IT COSTS NOTHING TO FILL, which is the part that makes it worth building. The worker
// already reads every missing slab into a staging buffer and throws that buffer away. Here the
// read goes STRAIGHT INTO an L2 slot and the upload sources from there, so filling the tier is
// not an extra copy - it is the same copy, kept. A design that memcpy'd into the tier after the
// read would spend more per fill than a later hit returns, and would be worse than no tier.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO: catch a cold first touch. Those bytes have never been read, so no cache of
// any size holds them. Over the ten-task gate of 2026-08-06, cold misses were 10,363 of 301,864 -
// the rest are evictions, and only those are addressable here.

// PINNED, and it asks ggml rather than CUDA: ggml_backend_dev_host_buffer_type() is the backend's
// own page-locked allocator, so this file stays free of any one backend. If the device has none,
